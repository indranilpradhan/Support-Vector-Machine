# Support-Vector-Machine

1. Given a dataset which contains a excerpts of text written by some author and the
corresponding author tag, implement an SVM classifier to predict the author tag
of the test text excerpts.
2. For the feature extraction of the text segments, either use Vectorizers provided in
sklearn or use pre-trained word embedding models. ( Code snippet for usage of
word embedding models is given here).
3. Visualize the feature vectors and see if you could find some pattern.
4. Tweak different parameters of the Linear SVM and report the results.
5. Experiment different kernels for classification and report the results.
6. Report accuracy score, F1-score, Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel
useful.
7. (Bonus-20 points) You may do some pre-processing on textual data to improve
your classifier. Explain why score has improved if it did.
8. Link to the dataset has been provided in the common link.
9. You can use inbuilt functions for SVM.
